# SyncNote
A notepad that saves user note in the cloud and synchronizes it on all their devices. It can be accessed on the web and also as desktop and mobile app with it's progressive web app feature

You can check it out live on https://syncnote365.web.app

It is absolutely free to use by anyone but it is not publicly distributed yet. I intend to maintain it on weekends and reel out new features until it comes in tasty enough and meets my basic desire in a note taker that is yet to be satisfied with all the note taking apps out there.

### Here are the current features of the app
* Create, view, update and delete notes
* Install as mobile and desktop as a progressive web app
* Create an account seamlessly in a matter of seconds by simply linking your google account (optional).
* After initial install, internet is not required for subsequent usage.
* Synchronizes your data across your devices provided you've created account.

### And some cool features on the way
* Auto generated note sharing link
* Recycle bin
* Draggable notes
* Themes
* Reminders
* Collaboration
* Etc... (NB: not in any particular order)
